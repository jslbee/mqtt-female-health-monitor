# Women's Health Monitoring System (Based on MQTT Protocol)

This project is a health monitoring system designed for women's well-being, utilizing the MQTT protocol for real-time data transmission. The system focuses on collecting and visualizing health-related data such as:

- Body temperature  
- Emotional status  
- Menstrual cycle  

Data can be collected via sensors or manual input, then transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. The backend stores and processes the data, and the frontend provides user-friendly visualizations and analysis.

## Project Structure (In Progress)
## Features (Planned)

- Real-time data transmission via MQTT  
- Backend service for data storage and processing
